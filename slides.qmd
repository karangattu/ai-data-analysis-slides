## How AI is Created

**Step 1: Collect massive amounts of text**

![](assets/reading_all_books.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

{{< fa database >}} Billions of pages from the internet, books, research papers, code repositories
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
{{< fa filter >}} Remove spam, personal data, and low-quality text
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
{{< fa balance-scale >}} Curate a balanced dataset covering many topics
:::

## {{< fa right-left >}} Convert words to vectors

Imagine you’re playing a video game where you have to create a character. You have sliders for different traits:

- Strength: 10
- Magic: 2
- Speed: 8

::: fragment
That list of numbers *(10, 2, 8)* is a vector.
:::

## {{< fa cube >}}

::: fragment
For the word "Apple," the sliders might look like:

- Is it Food?: 0.98 (Very high)
- Is it Tech?: 0.85 (Pretty high)
- Is it Red?: 0.90 (Very high)
- Is it a Planet?: 0.01 (Almost zero)
:::

::: fragment
The vector for "Apple" is just a long list of these numbers: **\[0.98, 0.85, 0.90, 0.01...\]**.
:::

## {{< fa exclamation >}} Wait, What?

::: fragment
If you take the vector for **King** subtract the vector for **Man** and add the vector for **Woman** the resulting numbers will lead you almost perfectly to the vector for **Queen**.
:::

::: fragment
#### King - Man + Woman = Queen
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-tip
The computer doesn't "know" what a Queen is; it just knows that the mathematical distance between those concepts is identical.
:::
::::

## {{< fa wrench >}} Fine-tuning

::: fragment
Imagine I give you a sentence: "The astronaut climbed into the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
:::

::: fragment
You’d probably guess "rocket" or "spaceship." You wouldn't guess "sandwich."
:::

::: fragment
The AI does this **trillions** of times. During training, it’s shown a sentence with the last word hidden. It makes a random guess.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
{{< fa users >}} Human experts label examples of good vs. bad responses
:::
::::

## {{< fa robot >}} Why modern AI feels so human?

::: fragment
If you said, "The bank was closed because the river overflowed," an older AI might think you were talking about a place where you keep your money.
:::

::: fragment
The *Attention* mechanism acts like a **spotlight**. When the modern AI sees the word "bank," its spotlight instantly swings over to the word "river."
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-tip
**Context is King**: The *Attention* mechanism allows the AI to understand that one word can have five different meanings depending on its "neighbors."
:::
::::

## {{< fa head-side-cough >}}Why doesn't the AI give the same answer every time?

::: fragment
Because of a setting called *Temperature*.
:::

::: fragment
- **Low Temperature (0.1 - 0.3):** The AI always picks the #1 most likely word. It’s very logical but boring.
- **High Temperature (0.7 - 1.0):** The AI is allowed to pick the 3rd or 10th most likely word. This is where "creativity" comes from.
:::

## {{< fa skull >}} Extreme Improv aka Hallucinations

::: fragment
On rare/obscure topics (e.g., a niche local law, a new species), the model may not have enough signal to be sure.
:::

::: fragment
But it still has to predict the next token—so it keeps going.
:::

::: fragment
> Ask something impossible (“Why did George Washington invent the internet?”) and it may confidently improvise.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-warning
The danger isn’t just being wrong—it’s sounding certain.
:::
::::

## Tokens

::: fragment
AI doesn't see *words.* It sees *tokens*.
:::

::: fragment
A Token is usually a word piece. For example, *unhappiness* might be split into `un`, `happi`, and `ness`— *3* tokens.
:::

::: fragment
{{< fa hippo >}} Asking an AI something and getting a response consumes tokens.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
Think of *tokens* as Lego blocks of language. If you give a child a Lego set, they don't see a *Castle*; they see 400 individual plastic bricks.
:::
::::

## Context Length

- Context length is the amount of info the AI can *hold in its head* to answer your specific question.

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
{{< fa face-tired >}} Just like a tired student skimming a textbook, the AI's "attention" is strongest at the start and the finish, but it "zones out" during the long middle stretch!
:::
::::

## {{< fa calculator >}} Limits of Context Length

::: fragment
Most modern AI models can handle between **200,000** and **1,000,000** tokens of context.
:::

:::: fragment
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
{{< fa thumbs-up >}} **1,000 tokens** is roughly *750 words* (about the length of a two-page essay).
:::
::::

## {{< fa bell >}} Welcome Gemini! {.center}

**Gemini** is Google's family of AI models, designed to rival other leading AI models.

::: fragment
**What's special about Gemini?**

- {{< fa handshake-angle >}} Built to handle **extremely long context lengths** (up to 1 million tokens!)
