{{< fa balance-scale >}} Curate a balanced dataset covering many topics
:::

## {{< fa right-left >}} Convert words to vectors

Imagine you’re playing a video game where you have to create a character. You have sliders for different traits:

- Strength: 10
- Magic: 2
- Speed: 8

::: fragment
That list of numbers *(10, 2, 8)* is a vector.
:::

## {{< fa cube >}}

::: fragment
For the word "Apple," the sliders might look like:

- Is it Food?: 0.98 (Very high)
- Is it Tech?: 0.85 (Pretty high)
- Is it Red?: 0.90 (Very high)
- Is it a Planet?: 0.01 (Almost zero)
:::

::: fragment
The vector for "Apple" is just a long list of these numbers: **\[0.98, 0.85, 0.90, 0.01...\]**.
:::

## {{< fa exclamation >}} Wait, What?

::: fragment
If you take the vector for **King** subtract the vector for **Man** and add the vector for **Woman** the resulting numbers will lead you almost perfectly to the vector for **Queen**.
:::

::: fragment
#### King - Man + Woman = Queen
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-tip
The computer doesn't "know" what a Queen is; it just knows that the mathematical distance between those concepts is identical.
:::
::::

## {{< fa wrench >}} Fine-tuning

::: fragment
Imagine I give you a sentence: "The astronaut climbed into the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
:::

::: fragment
You’d probably guess "rocket" or "spaceship." You wouldn't guess "sandwich."
:::

::: fragment
The AI does this **trillions** of times. During training, it’s shown a sentence with the last word hidden. It makes a random guess.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
{{< fa users >}} Human experts label examples of good vs. bad responses
:::
::::

## {{< fa robot >}} Why modern AI feels so human?

::: fragment
If you said, "The bank was closed because the river overflowed," an older AI might think you were talking about a place where you keep your money.
:::

::: fragment
The *Attention* mechanism acts like a **spotlight**. When the modern AI sees the word "bank," its spotlight instantly swings over to the word "river."
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-tip
**Context is King**: The *Attention* mechanism allows the AI to understand that one word can have five different meanings depending on its "neighbors."
:::
::::

## {{< fa head-side-cough >}}Why doesn't the AI give the same answer every time?

::: fragment
Because of a setting called *Temperature*.
:::

::: fragment
- **Low Temperature (0.1 - 0.3):** The AI always picks the #1 most likely word. It’s very logical but boring.
- **High Temperature (0.7 - 1.0):** The AI is allowed to pick the 3rd or 10th most likely word. This is where "creativity" comes from.
:::

## {{< fa skull >}} Extreme Improv aka Hallucinations

::: fragment
On rare/obscure topics (e.g., a niche local law, a new species), the model may not have enough signal to be sure.
:::

::: fragment
But it still has to predict the next token—so it keeps going.
:::

::: fragment
> Ask something impossible (“Why did George Washington invent the internet?”) and it may confidently improvise.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-warning
The danger isn’t just being wrong—it’s sounding certain.
:::
::::

## Tokens

::: fragment
AI doesn't see *words.* It sees *tokens*.
:::

::: fragment
A Token is usually a word piece. For example, *unhappiness* might be split into `un`, `happi`, and `ness`— *3* tokens.
:::

::: fragment
{{< fa hippo >}} Asking an AI something and getting a response consumes tokens.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
Think of *tokens* as Lego blocks of language. If you give a child a Lego set, they don't see a *Castle*; they see 400 individual plastic bricks.
:::
::::

## Context Length

- Context length is the amount of info the AI can *hold in its head* to answer your specific question.

:::: fragment
::: callout-note
{{< fa face-tired >}} Just like a tired student skimming a textbook, the AI's "attention" is strongest at the start and the finish, but it "zones out" during the long middle stretch!
:::
::::

## {{< fa calculator >}} Limits of Context Length

::: fragment
Most modern AI models can handle between **200,000** and **1,000,000** tokens of context.
:::

:::: fragment
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
{{< fa thumbs-up >}} **1,000 tokens** is roughly *750 words* (about the length of a two-page essay).
:::
::::

## {{< fa bell >}} Welcome Gemini! {.center}

**Gemini** is Google's family of AI models, designed to rival other leading AI models.

::: fragment
**What's special about Gemini?**

:::

{{< countdown "2:00" >}}

## {{< fa ban >}} AI does not have access to your data (by default)

::: fragment
{{< fa hand-point-up >}} It can help if you provide the data in the prompt.
:::

::: fragment
{{< fa file-upload >}}You can upload files in Gemini and reference them in your prompts.
:::

::: fragment
{{< fa paste >}} Or paste the data directly into the prompt.
:::

## Recommended data formats when uploading to Gemini

A `CSV` (Comma separated Values) file is the gold standard for making tabular data accessible to AI models.

::: fragment
*What is a CSV file?*
:::

::: fragment
A `CSV` is basically a spreadsheet stripped away all of all the colorful borders, the bold fonts, and the complex formulas.
:::

## CSV format

::: fragment
| Item   | Quantity | Price  |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Apples | 6        | \$3.00 |
| Milk   | 1        | \$4.50 |
:::

::: fragment
CSV looks like this:

``` csv
Item, Quantity, Price
Apples, 6, $3.00
Milk, 1, $4.50
```
:::

::: fragment
::: callout-tip
{{< fa file-csv >}} The first line is the "Header", and every line after that is a "Row".
:::
:::

## Why is CSV the "Gold Tier" format for AI?

- Since CSV is raw data, they are the most token efficient.
- Every computer on Earth, understands CSV files.
- Programming languages have built-in functions to read and write CSV files.


::: fragment
::: callout-tip
{{< fa code >}} By giving the AI a CSV, you are handing a carpenter a perfectly cut piece of wood instead of a whole tree.
:::

::: fragment
“Analyze bird count data.” {{< fa xmark >}} Too vague!
:::

::: fragment
- What role should Gemini play?
- What exactly should it analyze?
- What format should the output be in?
:::


## What makes a good prompt?

Good prompts include:

::: fragment
- {{< fa user-tag >}} **Role** — who the model is

- {{< fa tasks >}} **Task** — what to do

- {{< fa database >}} **Data** — input

- {{< fa ruler >}} **Constraints** — format, length, method

- {{< fa lightbulb >}} **Examples** — optional but powerful
:::

## Try this template

```csv
## Role
You are an ornithological data analyst specializing in shorebird migration patterns and wetland ecology.

## Task
Analyze the provided 10-week bird survey dataset from three San Francisco Bay sites (Palo Alto Baylands, Don Edwards NWR, Eden Landing) and identify:

1. **Temporal Trends**: How do species counts change across weeks? Are there any peak migration periods?
2. **Site Preferences**: Which species prefer which sites? Calculate total counts and averages per site-species combination.
3. **Environmental Correlations**: 
   - Is there a relationship between temperature and bird counts?
   - Do tide heights affect species presence?
   - Does moon phase correlate with observation frequency?
4. **Species Dominance**: Rank species by total abundance and identify the most/least common.

## Data
<copy the CSV data here>

## Constraints
- Provide specific numbers and percentages to support your findings
- Format output with clear headers and bullet points
- Highlight any surprising or counter-intuitive patterns
- Keep the analysis concise (under 300 words)

## Examples
Good insight format: "Dunlin counts peaked in Week 6 at Palo Alto Baylands (3,120 birds), coinciding with the highest tide (5.0 ft) and full moon phase."

## {{< fa chart-line >}} Visualization Best Practices

When asking AI to create visualizations, be specific about:

::: {.fragment}
**Chart Design**

- Chart type (bar, line, scatter, heatmap)
- Why this chart fits your data story
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Data Mapping**

- X-axis: what variable goes horizontal
- Y-axis: what variable goes vertical
- Color: what dimension to encode with color
:::



## {{< fa pen-ruler >}} Example: Crafting a Visualization Prompt

**Dataset:** Weekly bird counts across three sites

```csv

## {{< fa check >}} Strong Visualization Prompt Example

```
## Role
You are a data visualization specialist for bird conservation non-profit.

## Task
Create a line chart showing Dunlin population trends across three 
San Francisco Bay sites over 4 weeks.

## Data
<paste CSV here>

## Visualization Specifications
- Chart type: Line chart with points marked at each data point
- X-axis: Week (1-4)
- Y-axis: Bird count (scale from 0 to 4000)
- Color: One color per site (Palo Alto=blue, Don Edwards=green, Eden=pink)
- Style: Clean, publication-ready style with grid lines

## Annotations
- Add a title: "Dunlin Population Trends by Site (Weeks 1-4)"
- Label each line directly or use a legend
- Highlight the highest count with an annotation
- Add subtle grid lines for readability

## Output
Provide chart with these specifications.
```

## {{< fa hands-clapping >}} Your Turn: Craft a Visualization Prompt

{{< countdown "05:00" >}}

**Choose one of your datasets from earlier and write a detailed prompt for creating a visualization.**

Include:

1. **Chart type** — What best shows your data's story?
2. **Axes** — What maps to X and Y?
3. **Color** — What dimension should be color-coded?
4. **Annotations** — What labels or highlights are needed?

## {{< fa mug-hot >}} Break Time! {.center}

{{< countdown "5:00" >}}

## {{< fa backward >}} Recap {.center}

- Good prompts are specific about roles, tasks, data, constraints, and examples.
- AI can assist with various data analysis tasks, from cleaning to report writing.
- Clear visualization prompts lead to better graphical outputs.
